# Non-Trivial Squares and Sidorenko's Conjecture

Source code for my combinatorics research.

We categorize the bipartite graphs H on at most 7 edges for which t(H; G) â‰¥ t(K2; G)^|E(H)| has a sum of squares certificate.

For a longer introduction to the core concepts, formalisms, proofs, overview of the algorithms and some results, 
please see [Non-Trivial Squares and Sidorenko's Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10058.pdf).
